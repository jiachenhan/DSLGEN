# Corresponding to prompt 2 in paper, narrow the search space for candidate expressions and statements
TASK_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = """I hope to summarize the violations in the code into defect templates, and the template \
can be used to detect similar violation in other codebase. I will provide you with the elements of \
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the original code. And your task is to analyze each AST Node and determine \
whether it should appear in template.

For example: \
The Error code is
```java
    Class c = new String().getClass();
```

The violation info is
```
Avoid instantiating an object just to call getClass() on it; use the .class public member instead.
```

Your should think like the following:
* Step 1: Analysis the violation
The violation means that new String() is an object creation, and method invocation "getClass()" shouldn't be called \
on an objectCreation Node.
* Step 2: Guessing possible defect templates
This template can be described as a DSL like the following:
```DSL
    functionCall f1 where and(
        f1.base is ObjectCreation,
        f1.name == "getClass"
    );
```
This DSL can retrieve all method invocation which name is 'getClass' and its target is an object creation. \
And you can summarize other defects to DSL, which can effectively describe such defects.

For Name and Literal nodes, if the literal value can be summarized by regular expressions, this node is also important.
For example the following DSL.
```DSL
    functionCall f1 where f1.name match "(?i).*set(Accessible|Visiable)";
```

* Step 3: Mapping DSL to the important AST Nodes
Based on the DSL, the important AST Nodes are
1. MethodInvocation `new String().getClass()`
2. ClassCreation `new String()`
3. SimpleName `getClass`

After this analysis process, you can know which AST nodes are important.

# Prompt in engineering implementation, in order to reduce the code related to violation
ROUGH_SELECT_LINES_PROMPT = """Based on your analysis, Please select which lines are critical\
for this violation and record their line numbers. 

Note: A code line is critical if it is part of a defective code snippet.
Note: If this kind of violation occurs more than once, you only need to keep the line numbers \
of one defective code fragment and ignore the other defective code lines. \
Because the template will be accurate if only use one code snippet.

For example:
The buggy code
```java
    2: public void testNewReader() throws IOException {
    3: File asciiFile = getTestFile("ascii.txt");
    4: try {
    5:   Files.newReader(asciiFile, null);
    6:   fail("expected exception");
    7: } catch (NullPointerException expected) {
    8: }
    9: 
    10: try {
    11:   Files.newReader(null, Charsets.UTF_8);
    12:   fail("expected exception");
    13: } catch (NullPointerException expected) {
    14: }
    16: 
    17: BufferedReader r = Files.newReader(asciiFile, Charsets.US_ASCII);
    18: try {
    19:   assertEquals(ASCII, r.readLine());
    20: } finally {
    21:   r.close();
    22: }
  }
```
